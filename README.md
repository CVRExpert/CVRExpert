- 👋 Hi, I’m @CVRExpert
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision Recognition. Inspite of greate abilities of new NN generation algoritms, problem of recognition is still actual and will be in a nearest future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and developing recognition algoritms and telemetria services.

- 📫 How to reach me: escander@telemetria.su, WA, Telegramm, Viber: +79272648433
- 😄 Pronouns: My name is Aleksandr.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I owe every my skills to my clients. They didn’t want to hire me, so I had to organize my own company. They didn’t want to buy my software, so I had to provide them with a service. Now I have experience, technology, a set of products and a stable income.
